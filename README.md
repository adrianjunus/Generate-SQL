# Generate-SQL

A while ago I talked to a group regarding this topic. The group has multiple (hundreds) of sensors deployed across the world and needed a way to generate SQL scripts based on the information that was being fed from the sensors, which would move into a visualization that clients could see. At the time I wasn't knowledgable enough to offer my services right away, but over time I moved towards building a basic representation of a method from what we talked about regarding their problem statement. I wasn't technically supposed to see their data and have no legal affiliation so I made a similar data-set from scratch and made myself a format for searching sensor data and delivering SQL scripts based on the insights. Real applications would need to consider memory-handling, streaming, and core-partitioning which could be done using PySpark (perhaps this will be the next iteration of this)
